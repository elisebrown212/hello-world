# hello-world
Simply print out hello world!
My name is Elise Brown & I love to code! 
I've had a github in the past for course assignments, but I now created this one to save personal coding scripts and projects.

I'm excited to see the growth of this github page overtime. And how advanced my skills will get! :)
